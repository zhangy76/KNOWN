This repository includes the Pytorch demo code and trained models for the above paper. 

## Installation
```bash
conda create -n known python=3.8
conda activate known
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Demo
KNOWN is the first 3D human body reconstruction model that can quantify both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty (running in near real-time). We here provide the demo code to generate 3D reconstruction and visualize the 3D vertex prediction uncertainty (epistemic uncertainty).
```bash
python demo_img.py --img_path 'path to a testing image'
python demo_live_video.py --video_path 'empty to open a live camera or path to a testing video'
```

Examples of KNOWN's output are <br />
